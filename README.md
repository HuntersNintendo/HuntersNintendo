# boo! it's me, Cameo! or you can refer to Hunter, Scraps, and Millipede.👋
# I am agender, but I mostly use he/him, they/them, and it/its. if it makes it easier, you can just use he/him only. 😮
# I really enjoy Disventure camp! I rewatch the episodes daily... especially for Tom, Jake, Hunter, Gabby, Ellie, Kai, and Trevor. 🔥
# please refrain from venting to me or any other things like that, I am TERRIBLE AT FEELINGS! so I react very poorly : ( 😰
# that's all! you can always meet me on pony town in the carrot field as a Hunter pony in a SPECIFIX corner, which is my home, hope we interact! 😋
❕ take note I am very quiet when on ponytown and only talk if someone interacts with me or if it's one of my green names!
